Design and Development of a Military Robot for Surveillance and Defense purposes, using Rocker Bogie Mechanism

1.	INTRODUCTION                        
                    
A lot of the innovation in military robot development is taking place in the non-governing administrations; this has been the case since war vehicle development models were first conceptualized. Military and security establishments need robot frameworks as they can take on jobs that are excessively risky for individuals to do, and that are also too tedious or keep on for individuals to do. Robot frameworks likewise, hold the capacity to review organizations, territories, and for reconnaissance purposes. Here is the place robot frameworks could give a lot of administrations in serving the exact picture. It is conceivable to have swarms of robots that work together with their own particular sensors to have a much more precise locale.

Mobile robotics plays an undeniably significant job in military issues, from patrol to managing potential explosives. With appropriate sensors and cameras to perform distinctive missions robotics helps address difficulties presented by the phantom of urban fear based oppression. "Rather than having individuals draw near to dangers, for example, unattended items or vehicle bombs, robots are utilized. In the event that an administrator finishes up a risky item that may detonate, the robot could kill that article by shooting to explode it. These equivalent portable automated frameworks are utilized for killing or detonating overlooked weapons and mines after clashes stop. 

1.1	PROBLEM STATEMENT 

To design and fabricate a robot using a rocker bogie mechanism for surveillance and defense purposes.

1.2	OBJECTIVES
The objective is to design and fabricate a robot which can replace or assist the soldiers at places such as country border lines and other places where soldiers are needed to be deployed for defense purposes. The robot will basically be a rocker bogie mechanism equipped with various sensors, for surveillance; and will have a small gun actuated by a motor, for defense.

●	Design and Calculations: Aim is to design two rocker bogies, one for real life applications and other for the small prototype.

●	Modeling and Simulation: Aim is to model and simulate both the above designs in Solidworks.

●	Structural Analysis and Material Selection: Aim is to analyze the parts of the models in Ansys.

●	Manufacturing: Aim is to manufacture a small prototype.

●	Simulation and Implementation of Electronics Circuit with Sensors; and Arduino Coding: Aim is to simulate the electronics circuit and sensors in TinkerCad; and implement them on the prototype, using Arduino UNO.
